Can you check which place has the highest rated salmon sashimi from menya kanemaru, kitaro and akiko's sushi? Order the one with the highest rating; if there are no ratings, just go with the cheapest one. 

There are 3 Pho places near Georgia Tech: Nam Phuong Buford Highway, La Moon Atlanta, So Ba Vietnamese Restaurant. 
Please pick the one for me which has the highest rating, if they have around the same rating, then pick the cheapest one.
